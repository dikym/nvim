# My neovim config

This is my Neovim configuration file. Stolen from https://github.com/nauvalazhar/nvim.

## Installation

Require Neovim 0.9.4+

To install the pre-configured Neovim setup, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Neovim is installed on your system. If it isn't, you can install it by running the command `sudo apt-get install neovim`.
2. Open a terminal on your operating system.
3. Clone the Neovim configuration repository by running the command `git clone https://github.com/dikym/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`.
4. Open Neovim by running the command `nvim`.

Once this is done, your Neovim configuration is ready to use. Enjoy!
